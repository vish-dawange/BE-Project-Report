\indent\indent Concurrent programming is gaining popularity,
since Moore's law is nearing its end of life. The significant truth
is that processors aren't getting faster anymore, but you get more
cores.\\
\indent\indent In concurrent / parallel programming, one of the toughest
tasks for programmers is synchronizing the access of shared
memory to avoid basic problems of concurrency. While working
on a large code base, programmers may miss out synchronizing
certain critical section leaving the code vulnerable for race
conditions to occur.\\
\indent\indent We propose an approach that extends the capability of GCC to
identify all the critical sections in multithreaded programs which
has synchronization bugs, i.e. race conditions may occur due to
incorrect/no use of locking and unlocking mechanisms, which will
warn the programmers by pointing out the exact location where
the problems would occur.\\
\indent\indent Furthermore, it also provides synchronization to that section of
code, by introducing proper locking methods. This stage is
optional, and programmers may synchronize the section
themselves too.\\
