1) common.h

        Header contains structures for handling critical section and declarations	
	for genrating tables.								
											
	Structures defined contains the information extracted by the parser.		
	It contains the important parameters of C program which are helpful		
	in finding critical section. Tables generated from structures will		
	contain the information extracted from parser.	

2) Cbrace_stack.h

	Program contains stack opration which is used for handling curly brace.

	Main purpose of handling curly brace is to identify equal occurence of
	opening and closing curly brace. This would help to identify inner functions
	and can be helpful to identify the enttries of shadowing global variables.

3) main.l

        Lex file contains tokens, states, processing of tokens.

        Tokenization helps to break the input file into different tokens. By combining
        the tokens we can write grammar. File different tokens like C data types,
        pthread libraries, user-defined structures, semaphores, etc.
        States defined helps to ignroe unnecessary code.

4) util.c

 	Program contains generation of tables, processing of tables and displaying	
        output.										
 											
 	Tables are generated using the information generated by grammar written in	
 	yacc file. Functions are written to analyze those tables and generate		
 	required output. The information generated by these functions are stored in     
 	proper data structures and display functions are written to view the required   
        information stored in those structures.
